# Vial default keymap

This keymap is the same as the default, except for the below.
For more information on the layout,
  see the layout description in default/readme.md.

Space limits prompted these changes:

- Only a QWERTY base layer is provided.
  The base layout selection keys are also removed from the adjust layer.
- RGB underglow is disabled.
  You can re-enable it in rules.mk, but it is very tight on space.
